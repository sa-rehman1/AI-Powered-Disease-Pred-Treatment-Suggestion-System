## ✨ Key Features  

- **Disease Risk Prediction**  
  - Diabetes prediction from patient health records  
  - Heart disease prediction with probability scores  
  - Risk classification (Low, Moderate, High) with intuitive visual indicators  

- **Interactive Patient Dashboard**  
  - Upload CSV health reports  
  - Real-time analysis and health metric visualization  
  - Critical alerts for abnormal values (e.g., high glucose, cholesterol, BP)  

- **AI-Driven Insights (GenAI + LangChain + RAG)**  
  - Personalized treatment suggestions  
  - Health improvement recommendations  
  - Summarized insights using **Large Language Models** via **Groq API**  

- **Reports & Health Trends**  
  - Track risk trends over time with interactive charts  
  - Generate and download **personalized PDF health summaries**  

- **Reminders & Notifications**  
  - Set reminders for medication, lab tests, or doctor visits  
  - Integrated task management for patients

## 🛠️ Tech Highlights  

- **Frontend & UI:** Streamlit (custom styled dashboard with visualizations)  
- **Data Science & ML:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib  
- **Generative AI & NLP:** LangChain + Groq API (for insights, RAG pipeline)  
- **System Design:** Modular ML pipeline, API integration, patient data storage, health monitoring automation

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out  

✅ Combines **ML + GenAI + APIs** for practical healthcare use cases  
✅ Implements **predictive analytics + personalized recommendations**  
✅ Showcases **real-world integration of AI models in an end-to-end system**  
✅ Designed for **scalability** — more diseases and AI models can be integrated  
✅ Built with a **recruiter-friendly stack**: ML, APIs, NLP, and RAG techniques

## 📌 Future Enhancements  

- Expand ML models to cover more diseases (kidney, liver, cancer screening)  
- Connect with wearable devices (Fitbit, Apple Watch) for real-time monitoring  
- Multi-user authentication (patient + doctor portals)  
- Deployment on cloud platforms (AWS/GCP) with secure DB integration
